## Installation

```shell
$ npm install buntstift
```

## Quick start

First you need to integrate buntstift into your application.

```javascript
const { buntstift } = require('buntstift');
```

If you use TypeScript, use the following code instead:

```typescript
import { buntstift } from 'buntstift';
```

To write messages to the console use the `success` and `error` functions to show that your application has succeeded or failed. If you want to provide additional information, use the `info` and `verbose` functions. In case of any warnings, use the `warn` function.

```javascript
buntstift.info('Updating...')
buntstift.success('Done.');
```

_Please note that `error` and `warn` write messages to the standard error stream, all other functions write them to the standard output stream._

Additionally, there is the `passThrough` function that does not do any formatting.

### Formatting messages

You can use the `options` object to change the prefix of the various message writing functions. For that, simply provide a `prefix` property and set it to the desired character.

```javascript
buntstift.error('App stopped.', { prefix: 'X' });
// => X App stopped.
```

## Printing headers

To print a header call the `header` function.

```javascript
buntstift.header('Running tests...');
```

You may change the right pointing character using the `prefix` property in the way described above.

## Printing blank lines

To print a blank line call the `newLine` function.

```javascript
buntstift.newLine();
```

## Printing lines

To print a line call the `line` function.

```javascript
buntstift.line();
```

## Using lists

To write a list to the console use the `list` function. Optionally, you may specify an indentation level. Setting the indentation level to `0` is equal to omitting it.

```javascript
buntstift.list('foo');
buntstift.list('bar');
buntstift.list('baz', { indent: 1 });

// => ∙ foo
//    ∙ bar
//      ∙ baz
```

You may change the bullet character using the `prefix` property in the way described above.

## Using tables

To write data formatted as a table use the `table` function. Provide the data as an array of arrays. If you want to insert a separator line, provide an empty array.

```javascript
buntstift.table([
  [ 'Key', 'Value' ],
  [],
  [ 'foo', 23 ],
  [ 'bar', 7 ]
]);

// => Key  Value
//    ───  ─────
//    foo     23
//    bar      7
```

The individual cells become padded automatically: Numbers are aligned to the right, anything else is aligned to the left.

## Enabling verbose and quiet mode

By default, only messages written by `success`, `error`, `info` and `warn` are shown on the console. To enable `verbose` as well, provide the `--verbose` command line switch when running the application. Alternatively, you may use its short form, `-v`.

If you want to disable any output except `error` and `warn`, provide the `--quiet` command line switch. Again, you may use its short form, `-q`.

## Enabling and disabling colors

If you run a cli application in non-interactive mode, i.e. scripted, using colors is automatically being disabled. If you want to force usage of colors, provide the `--color` command line switch.

In turn, if you want to force disable colors even when in interactive mode, provide the `--no-color` command line switch.

Alternatively, you may use the `forceColor` and `noColor` functions.

## Disabling UTF characters

If your system does not support UTF characters, disable them using the `--no-utf` command line switch.

Alternatively, you may use the `forceUtf` and `noUtf` functions.

## Waiting for long-running tasks

If your application performs a long-running task, you may use the `wait` function to show a waiting indicator to the user.

```javascript
const stop = buntstift.wait();

// ...
stop();
```

_Please note that the loading indicator is written to the application's standard error stream._

If you run the application using the `--quiet` command line switch, or if you run the application in non-interactive mode, no loading indicator will be shown at all.

## Getting user input

Besides the various ways to display information, buntstift is also able to get input from the user. For that, use the `ask`, `confirm` and `select` functions.

### Asking a question

If you want to ask a question to the user, use the `ask` function and provide a `question`:

```javascript
const answer = await buntstift.ask('What do you want to do today?');
```

Optionally, you may specify a regular expression to use as a mask to match the answer against:

```javascript
const answer = await buntstift.ask('What do you want to do today?', /.+/g);
```

Alternatively, you may specify a default value for the answer:

```javascript
const answer = await buntstift.ask('What do you want to do today?', 'coding');
```

If you want to provide both, i.e. a mask and a default value, provide an options object:

```javascript
const answer = await buntstift.ask('What do you want to do today?', {
  mask: /.+/g,
  default: 'coding'
});
```

To ask for a password, provide an options object and set the `echo` property to `false`:

```javascript
const password = await buntstift.ask('Please enter your password:', {
  echo: false
});
```

### Getting a confirmation

If you want to get a conformation from the user, use the `confirm` function and provide a `question`:

```javascript
const isSure = await buntstift.confirm('Are you sure?');
```

Unless specified otherwise, the default answer is `true`. To change this, provide `false` as second parameter:

```javascript
const isSure = await buntstift.confirm('Are you sure?', false);
```

### Selecting from a list

If you want the user to select a value from a list, use the `select` function and provide a `question` as well as a selection of choices:

```javascript
const favoriteColor = await buntstift.select('What is your favorite color?', [
  'red',
  'green',
  'blue'
]);
```

## Shutting down an application

To shutdown an application, call the `exit` function. Optionally, you may specify an exit code; if you don't, `0` is used.

```javascript
buntstift.exit();
```

## Chaining functions

If you want to run a number of actions as a sequence, you can chain all of buntstift's synchronous functions.

```javascript
buntstift.
  error('App failed.').
  exit(1);
```

## Running the build

To build this module use [roboter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roboter).

```shell
$ npx roboter
```
